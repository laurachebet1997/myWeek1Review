        <ul>
            <li class="important">brief description</li>
            <P>This was when i was first introduced to github and tried to go through their pages for <br>guidance on
                how to
                go about it.</P>
            <p>it helped me navigate through the basic topics although i did not get deeper.</p>
            <li class="important">languages used</li>
            <p>this was all about documentations so text typos were included only</p>
        </ul>
        <li class="intro">newgitme</li>
        <ul>
            <li class="important">brief description</li>
            <p>here,you will find a statement used to help me navigate through the README file since i had not caught up

        <ul>
            <li class="important">brief description</li>
            <p>This was a setup that allowed me to know how git repositories were made as a remote one,which should be
                used
                in cases of cloning<br>and push/pull requests.</p>
            <li class="important">languages used</li>
            <p>no launguages specified here,it was just a process of clicks on my github account.</p>

        <li class="intro">hello-world</li>
        <ul>
            <li class="important">brief description</li>
            <p>After this,i had to go back to my lessons and learn html while trying to use the practical version.</p>
            <p>in short,this is my first trial website i did to ensure that i got what i was supposed to do</p>
            <li class="important">languages used</li>
            <p>alot of this was HTML:4</p>

        <ul>
            <li class="important">brief description</li>
            <P>On this repository,i created a new website based on what i had learnt from the previous repository on my
                own.

                <P>My previous repo had troubles connecting to a live server and i had to find a way by <br> asking for
                    help
                    from friends.</P>
                <p>Once i got the procedure correct,this repository came by.</p>

            <h1>ABOUT ME:</h1>
            <P class="description">Here is what am going to share about myself;</P>
            <ul>
                <li>Am a student at jkuat doing business course.</li>

            <p class="description">Reason for choosing coding</p>
            <p>i wanted to venture into business <strong>online </strong>and i thought i should know about coding so i do not have to
                rely <br>
                on google on everything i do.</p>
            <p>there was a <em>desire</em> to always know what happens behind whatever am doing like how information reaches my
                client or
                how to go about on <strong>advert logarithms</strong>.</p>
